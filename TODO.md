## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod tidy
npm install

# Run development server
go run . serve

# Build for production
go run . build
```

### Database Setup
1. Run the migration: `migrations/001_list_initial.sql`
2. Configure RLS policies as needed
3. Update Supabase types: `npx supabase gen types typescript`

### Key Files
- **Go Server**: `main.go`, `list.go`, `config.go`
- **React App**: `index.tsx`, `components/ListApp.tsx`
- **Data Layer**: `data/ContentRepository.ts`, `data/SupabaseClient.ts`
- **Database**: `migrations/001_list_initial.sql`

## Architecture Decisions

### ‚úÖ Decisions Made
1. **Supabase** for backend (authentication, database, real-time)
2. **Go + esbuild** for local development server (following claudemd pattern)
3. **React** for frontend with functional components and hooks
4. **Tailwind CSS** for styling (via CDN)
5. **Text-only content** for initial release
6. **Group-based collaboration** model

### ü§î Future Considerations
1. **State Management**: Consider Redux/Zustand for complex state
2. **Testing Strategy**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
3. **Deployment**: Docker + cloud hosting vs static site
4. **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, analytics for usage
5. **Content Storage**: File storage strategy for media uploads

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Text-only content (by design for v1)
- Basic error handling
- No offline support
- Limited mobile optimization
- No comprehensive testing

### Technical Debt
- Missing comprehensive error boundaries
- No proper loading states in all components
- Limited input validation
- No rate limiting
- Basic security measures

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals
- [ ] User can create account and join groups
- [ ] Real-time content updates work reliably
- [ ] Basic error handling prevents crashes
- [ ] Mobile users can use core features

### Long-term Goals
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for core features
- [ ] <2s page load times
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness score >90
- [ ] User retention >50% after 1 week

## Notes for Developers

### Code Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow existing naming conventions from justshare
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript strictly for type safety

### Performance Considerations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize re-renders with useCallback/useMemo
- Consider content pagination strategies

### Security Considerations
- All database access goes through RLS policies
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize content before display
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regular security audits of Supabase policies
